Mechanical Design for the Velo Bling-Bling Mounting Frame
*********************************************************

http://veloblingbling.ch

LED lights for bicycle wheels. 16 multi color LEDs on each side (PCB top- and
bottom side).

There are two windows (upper and lower) on each side for display dynamic
information like speed, trip time, trip distance, etc. or static
information like strings and images.

It is possible to mount the PCB direct onto the wheel spokes but it is better
to use a mounting frame. This frame can be ordered from http://shapeways.com
or you can print it by yourself on 3D printer.

The 3D models are created with OpenSCAD.
